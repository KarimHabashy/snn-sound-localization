# 2. Get acquainted with the subject

[**Watch the two videos**][vids] of Dan Goodman's tutorial on spiking neural network (SNN) models.

<!-- The following is MyST syntax to create a collapsible container
    ("Click to show more"). ‚Üí https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/hiding.html
-->
```{admonition} Topics covered in the videos
:class: dropdown

[**Video 1**][vid1]
- Spiking neuron models (LIF and more)
- Intro to the sound localization problem
- The classic delay line / **coincidence detection** model of sound localization
    - The notebook explained in this part ‚Äî from 32:40 on¬†‚Äî uses a package ([Brian](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/)) that we do not use here.
    This part is still relevant insofar that the introduced concepts are used in the next video and in our project.

[**Video 2**][vid2]
- Learning in neural networks, and **surrogate gradient descent** for SNNs.
- Training an SNN for sound localization using PyTorch.
    - **This part ‚Äî [from 18:36 on][vid2-nb] ‚Äî explains our [Starting Notebook](research/Starting-Notebook.ipynb)**.
```
The slides, and links for learning more, are available at the [tutorial website](https://neural-reckoning.github.io/cosyne-tutorial-2022/).

Then, read [](research/Background.md) for a brief introduction to the auditory system and sound localization, and for links to previous modelling work in sound localization.

# 3. Pick a research question

Visit [](research/Questions.md) to find inspiration for something you'd like to try out or investigate.

```{margin}
It is hard to say beforehand where research will lead you, so you can of course change this at any time.
```

Edit that page and **add your name to an item**, or add a new item:

```{admonition} How to edit the Questions page
:class: dropdown

On the [](research/Questions.md) page, **via the GitHub logo at the top, click "suggest edit"** (or go there directly using [this link][edit-questions]).
Sign up / log in to GitHub if needed, and edit the markdown text there to add your name / research question.

If you are not already a member of our GitHub organization, GitHub will warn you that "You‚Äôre making changes in a project you don‚Äôt have write access to."
Make your edit anyway and click the green "Propose changes" button.
This will make a Pull Request to our project. We will merge it, and add you to our GitHub organization.

If you are already a member, you can simply choose "Commit directly to the `main` branch".
```

# 4. Work in a notebook

The [](research/Starting-Notebook) contains a basic analysis pipeline.

<details><summary>Overview of the starting notebook</summary>

- A simple sound localization task is defined, and input/output data for it are generated.
    - The task: given a pure tone that arrives with a delay in one ear, calculate the interaural phase difference (IPD).
- An SNN model is defined, and trained on this data, using surrogate gradient descent.
- The model's performance is analyzed, and its learned weights are visualized.
</details><br>

This notebook is a good starting point for you own experiments.

**Duplicate the [](research/Starting-Notebook)** and work on your experiment in this copy, using either Google Colab or a local setup:

```{admonition} How to work with Google Colab ‚òÅ
:class: dropdown
On the [](research/Starting-Notebook) page, **via the rocket icon at the top, click "Colab"** (or go there directly via [this link][colab-start-nb]).

For an intro to the Colab interface and its keyboard shortcuts, see [here][colab-help].

To save your changes, use one of the "Save a copy ‚Ä¶" options in the File menu.
(You can choose either your personal GitHub / GitHub Gists, or your Google Drive).

When you have something ready to share, **'Download' the notebook as an .ipynb file** via the File menu. See the next step for how to share this file and have it appear on this website.

````{admonition} How to work locally üíª
:class: dropdown

Below are detailed instructions to get set up locally.  
If you are already familiar with such instructions however, the summary is:

1. Install `conda` if it is not already installed.
    - <small>The recommended installer is [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download): it is lean, and is generally faster than installers like Miniconda, as it only uses the `conda-forge` channel by default.</small>
2. Download [the repository](https://github.com/comob-project/snn-sound-localization).
3. Run, in the repo root:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate spikeloc
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Detailed steps (click to expand):


<details>
<summary>1. <b>Install Conda</b></summary>

- If you do not have `conda` already installed, download and run 
  the _Miniforge3_ conda installer for your OS over at
  https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download.

- On Windows: in step 5 of the installer ("Advanced Installation Options"),
  tick the checkbox next to "Add Miniforge3 to my PATH environment variable".
  
- On MacOS, Ubuntu, etc, go to 'Terminal' and run `chmod +x` on the downloaded `.sh` file, then run it
  with `./Miniforge3-{os}-{arch}.sh`.

  For Mac, there is also a `.pkg` installer available: a file to download and to install by just double-clicking it.
  Find it [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links) (_Miniconda_ is similar to Miniforge: they are both lean installers for `conda`).
</details>


<details>
<summary>2. <b>Download the repository</b></summary>

- On [our GitHub](https://github.com/comob-project/snn-sound-localization), at the top of the page, click the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP".
  Uncompress the downloaded `.zip` to a location of your choosing.

- Alternatively, if you use Git, you can `git clone` the repository
</details>


<details>
<summary>3. <b>Open a terminal in the repository directory</b></summary>

- On Windows, either search the Start menu for the built-in 'Command Prompt', 
  or install the more modern [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal#readme)
  from the Microsoft Store ([link](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)).
  
- On MacOS or e.g. Ubuntu, run 'Terminal'.

- To run the commands in the following steps, either type or copy-paste them
  into the terminal, and hit `Enter`.

- After starting the terminal, you can use the `cd` command to point it
  to the exercise directory. For example, if you extracted the `.zip` contents
  to `C:\Users\jane\Desktop`, run
  ```
  cd C:\Users\jane\Desktop\snn-sound-localization-main\`
  ```
  (If you `git clone`d the repository, the directory is just called
  `snn-sound-localization`, without the branch name `-main`).
  
- Alternatively, you can directly open a terminal in the right directory
  using your OS's file explorer (Explorer on Windows, GNOME on Ubuntu, ‚Ä¶),
  by right clicking in the directory.
  - If you've installed Windows Terminal or are e.g. on Ubuntu,
    simply select "Open in (Windows) Terminal" from the right-click menu.
  - This is not applicable to vanilla Windows. (You could hold `Shift`
    while right clicking, and then select "Open PowerShell window here",
    but the `jupyter notebook` command below does not work
    by default in PowerShell).
  
- Your final directory should be the one where the `research/` subdirectory and an
  `environment.yml` file are located. Use `ls` (or `dir` in Windows' Command Prompt) to
  see a list of the files in the current directory.
</details>


<details>
<summary>4. <b>Install dependencies</b></summary>

- With your Terminal pointing to the exercise directory, run the following command:
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```
  This will download and install all dependencies.
  It will take a while.
  
- If any errors pop up, retry the command with elevated privileges.
  - On Windows, close the terminal and reopen it with "Run as Administrator".
  - On most other OSes (including MacOS), prepend `sudo` to the command;
    i.e. `sudo conda env create ‚Ä¶`, and enter the password when prompted.

- When the installation was succesful, run
  ```
  conda activate spikeloc
  ```
  This makes sure that all future commands ran in this terminal
  will use the installed software.
</details>


<details>
<summary>5. <b>Run the notebook server</b></summary>

- Still in this terminal in the exercise directory,
  with the `spikeloc` conda environment activated, run
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  After a short while, this should open your browser,
  showing a list of the files in the current directory. 

- Click on the `research/` directory and then on `Starting-Notebook.ipynb` to open it.
  Try running some of the cells using `Shift`-`Enter`.
  If no errors apear below these cells: congratulations! The installation was succesful.

- Some more information on how to work with a Jupyter Notebook can be found
  e.g. [here](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/#running-cells).

- When you are done with the notebooks, you can exit the notebook server application
  that is still running in your terminal with `Ctrl`-`C`
</details>

````

Duplicating the starting notebook is a suggestion. You could also do one of the following:

<details><summary>Other ways to work</summary>

- Start from scratch in a new notebook
- Duplicate another notebook than the 'Starting' one, if you want to build on someone else's work
- If no code is needed, write a simple markdown file ('[](research/Background.md)' is an example of this).
- If you prefer scripts to Jupyter Notebooks, upload 1) the script (`.py` file), 2) the generated plots (image files), and 3) a `.md` file that describes the analysis and includes the plots (preferably placed in a subdirectory).
