Follow these steps to get started.


## 1. Join the community

[Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/GtdS9tQyU7), to chat about the project and follow announcements. <!-- (This is a never-expiring discord invite link) -->
If you have any questions, ask them on [our GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/comob-project/snn-sound-localization/discussions).
Participation in the community is subject to our [Code of Conduct](Code-of-Conduct.md).

You can check out where others are located in the world and add yourself on [this map ðŸ—º](https://getethermap.org/m/comob).


## 2. Get acquainted with the subject

[Watch][vids-pl] the two videos of Dan Goodman's tutorial on spiking neural network (SNN) models.

<!-- The following is MyST syntax to create a collapsible container.
     See: https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/hiding.html
-->
```{admonition} Topics covered in the videos
:class: dropdown

[**Video 1**][vid1]
- Spiking neuron models (LIF and more)
- Intro to the sound localization problem
- The classic delay line / **coincidence detection** model of sound localization
    - The notebook explained in this part â€” from 32:40 onÂ â€” uses a package ([Brian](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/)) that we do not use here.
    This part is still relevant insofar that the introduced concepts are used in the next video and in our project.

[**Video 2**][vid2]
- Learning in neural networks, and **surrogate gradient descent** for SNNs.
- Training an SNN for sound localization using PyTorch.
    - **This part â€” [from 18:36 on][vid2-nb] â€” explains our [Starting Notebook](research/Starting-Notebook.ipynb)**.
```
The slides, and links for learning more, are available at the [tutorial website](https://neural-reckoning.github.io/cosyne-tutorial-2022/).

Then, read [](research/Background.md) for a brief intro to the auditory system and sound localization, and for links to previous modelling work on sound localization.


## 3. Pick a problem

Visit [](research/Questions.md) to find inspiration for something you'd like to try out or investigate.

<!-- fork -->

[Edit that page](https://github.com/comob-project/snn-sound-localization/edit/main/research/Questions.md) and add your name to an existing item in the lists, or add a new item.

<!-- todo: how to collaps box. mayb text on page ipso (not so important) -->


## 4. Work in a notebook

[colab or local]


## 5. Share your notebook

[drag and drop]


## 6. Check out others' work

All our notebooks and research notes appear under the 'Research' rubric to the left.

You can **comment** in-situ on notebooks and other pages of this website (even this one, try it out!). Select some text and click 'Annotate'. You'll be prompted to login or sign up for a _Hypothesis_ account, after which you can comment and reply.

You can see others' comments using the far right sidebar.


## 7. Help write the paper


# ...


<!-- If you are already a member of the [COMOB github organization][1]: simply drag and drop your notebook file into the [`notebooks` directory on github][2].
Choose 'commit directly to the `main` branch' and press the 'Commit changes' button.
The website will be rebuilt automatically, and your notebook should appear on the website when this is done (the website build status can be checked [here][3])

If not, [fork the project, make PR], we'll merge and add you as org member so you can do as above.


pieter test â†’ fork, then upload in your repo (it'll prompt to PR)

what about changes. drag and drop overwrite? yes :)

can colab edit? no. so: File > Download .ipynb > [upload as before]
